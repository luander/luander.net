I"<p>I’m looking for a reason to start a blog for many years now. This might be it. An exercise to improve my writing skills. But I also want to keep my notes in a place that’s easy to find. Every now and then I test something, build something or just figure out something interesting and sooner rather than later I cannot find it anymore or even forget to take notes about the process, making building something the second time as it was the first all over again.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this goes…</p>
