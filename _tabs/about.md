# Who am I
My name is Luander Michel Ribeiro and I'm a Brazilian, born in the rural zone in the South of Minas Gerais state. My village at its peak hosted about 30 families and the closest town has around 15k inhabitants. 
The logical thing for me to do professionally was to plant potatoes together with my father. But I liked computers too much for that. I then decided that my professional career would be around computers. With my parent's help I was able to join a higher education school and graduated as a Computer Engineer.

Like many people from my hometown, I fell in love and married a local woman. She, by influence also became a computer engineer a few years after we met.

Briefly before finishing my studies I joined a Samsung-owned research and Development institute and got myself involved in Software Security focused on the Android Platform. After around 6 years I decided to move to the Netherlands to face other challenges and to grow as a person. Anna accepted the challenge and since 2017 we are now living in the Netherlands :)
I first worked as a security consultant for Philips Digital Pathology. The potential of taking pathology imaging one step further was quite attractive to me. After Philips I joined Schuberg Philis to take on a new challenge: securing Mission Critical environments. Since Oct. 2018 I work there and always learning and having fun along the way.

Amidst the 2020 pandemic we got a puppy dog to make us company and keep us sane, his name is Luke and he is a small dachshund.
