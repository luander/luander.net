# Kubernetes Security Testing Mindmap
Over the past months I've been looking at different Kubernetes clusters from different vendors and this mindmap helped me stay organized on what to look for when it comes to security testing.

In the mindmap there's a section dedicated to AWS and EKS including best practices, plus a Kubernetes section and an Istio section. Treat this mindmap as a checklist of stuff to hunt in the cluster.
